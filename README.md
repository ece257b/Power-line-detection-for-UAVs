# Power-line-detection-for-UAVs
This repository contains the Ansys project files for our course project in ECE257B
<br/>The Ansys project consists of the following designs, each for a different stage in the implementation.
<br/>1. Coax_Magnetic_field : Run this design to observe the magnetic field around the current carrying wire.
<br/>2. Coax_RCS : Run this design to observe the RCS plots for a coaxial cable. The frequency of operation can be edited in the setup.(Analysis-->Setup1)
<br/>3. Horn_antenna and Patch_antenna : These are the simulated antenna models that can be used to calculate maximum range of detection of the wire.
<br/>4. Radar_imaging : This SBR design is used to extract the s-parameters for radar-imaging. The exported data should be used as input to the RADAR_imaging.py code to observe the image plots.
<br/>5. SBR_VRT : This SBR design can be used to visualize rays incident and subsequently bouncing off of the wire.
